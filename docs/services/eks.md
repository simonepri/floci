# EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

**Protocol:** REST-JSON  
**Endpoint:** `http://localhost:4566/` (path-routed via JAX-RS)

EKS uses a standard REST API with JSON bodies: not the JSON 1.1 (`X-Amz-Target`) or Query protocol.

## Access-entry management

`CreateCluster` accepts `accessConfig.authenticationMode` (`CONFIG_MAP`, `API_AND_CONFIG_MAP`, or `API`) and `bootstrapClusterCreatorAdminPermissions`. The API default is `CONFIG_MAP`; access-entry operations require an ACTIVE cluster created with `API` or `API_AND_CONFIG_MAP`.

The four access-entry management operations support `STANDARD` (the default) and `EC2_LINUX`. STANDARD accepts existing IAM users or roles, including principals in another account. EC2_LINUX requires a role in the cluster account and generates `system:node:{{EC2PrivateDNSName}}`; custom usernames and Kubernetes groups are not accepted for node entries. Tags supplied at creation are preserved. Repeating a create with the same client token and normalized parameters returns the existing entry. Listing accepts `maxResults` from 1 to 100 and cluster-specific `nextToken` values.

Access entries use EKS storage and retain the IAM principal's stable ID internally. Cluster deletion removes its entries, and a cluster recreated with the same name does not inherit previous entries or pagination tokens.

### EC2 Linux worker authentication

IMDS instance-profile credentials authenticate through a matching `EC2_LINUX` entry as
`system:node:<private-DNS-name>` with `system:bootstrappers` and `system:nodes` groups.
The webhook verifies the signed token, cluster account/region/incarnation, stored role ID,
running EC2 instance, and attached instance profile. Missing/deleted entries, recreated roles,
revoked sessions and terminated instances are rejected without falling back to administrator access.
The existing k3s webhook cache can retain a successful authentication for up to 30 seconds.

New cluster webhook configurations carry the target account, region and creation timestamp in the URL path.
Kubernetes client-go replaces server URL query parameters when sending TokenReview requests, so
worker scope must not depend on those parameters.
Recreate older local clusters before using worker authentication; a legacy unscoped webhook
rejects instance credentials. Obtain fresh IMDS credentials after upgrading so the session
includes the stable role ID.

!!! note "Authentication scope"
    Non-worker IAM users and ordinary STS sessions retain the existing cluster-admin compatibility behavior. STANDARD entries, access policies, aws-auth ConfigMap, the cluster-creator bootstrap flag and automatic managed-node entries are not enforced by this change. Updating authentication mode, UpdateAccessEntry, access-policy association, and entry tag updates remain unimplemented. Native AL2023 images, bootstrap RBAC/CSR approval, CNI and worker networking are separate requirements for registration and Ready.

```bash
aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 eks create-cluster \
  --name local-nodes --role-arn arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/cluster \
  --resources-vpc-config '{}' \
  --access-config authenticationMode=API,bootstrapClusterCreatorAdminPermissions=false
# The IAM role must already exist.
aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 eks create-access-entry \
  --cluster-name local-nodes --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/worker \
  --type EC2_LINUX
```

## Pod Identity Associations

Floci supports the EKS Pod Identity association management plane. You can map a Kubernetes `(namespace, serviceAccount)` pair directly to an IAM role without configuring OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers or mutating ServiceAccount annotations.

### Management Plane Operations

- **Creation**: `CreatePodIdentityAssociation` associates a Kubernetes service account in a specific namespace with an IAM role ARN. The referenced IAM role must exist in IAM. A cluster cannot have duplicate associations for the same `(namespace, serviceAccount)` pair (rejected with HTTP 409 `ResourceInUseException`). Requests support idempotency via `clientRequestToken`.
- **Retrieval**: `DescribePodIdentityAssociation` retrieves full association details by cluster name and association ID (`a-` followed by 17 alphanumeric characters).
- **Listing**: `ListPodIdentityAssociations` returns summaries of associations for a cluster, with optional filtering by `namespace` and `serviceAccount`, plus pagination using `maxResults` (1-100) and cluster-bound `nextToken`.
- **Updating**: `UpdatePodIdentityAssociation` modifies the associated `roleArn`, `targetRoleArn`, `disableSessionTags`, or `policy`.
- **Deletion**: `DeletePodIdentityAssociation` removes an association and returns its final metadata. Deleting an EKS cluster automatically purges all of its pod identity associations.

### Limitations and Scope

Credentials delivery directly into pods is not yet supported:
- Mutating webhook injection for pod environment variables (`AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI`, `AWS_CONTAINER_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN_FILE`) is not implemented.
- The link-local metadata credential endpoint (`169.254.170.23`) is not implemented.

Applications running inside pods cannot currently exchange tokens for temporary AWS credentials via the link-local endpoint. Use access entries, node credentials, or explicit credential configuration until the pod identity agent endpoint is added.

## Cluster security group

When an EKS cluster is created with a VPC (either specified directly or resolved from subnets), Floci provisions a dedicated EC2 cluster security group and populates its ID in `cluster.resourcesVpcConfig.clusterSecurityGroupId` on both `CreateCluster` and `DescribeCluster` responses.

### Naming convention and description

The generated security group name follows the AWS pattern:

```
eks-cluster-sg-<cluster-name>-<suffix>
```

where `<suffix>` is an 8-character random hexadecimal string. The security group description is set to:

```
EKS created security group applied to ENI that is attached to EKS Control Plane master nodes, as well as any managed workloads.
```

### System tags

Floci tags the cluster security group with the standard AWS system tags:

- `Name`: `eks-cluster-sg-<cluster-name>-<suffix>`
- `kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-name>`: `owned`
- `aws:eks:cluster-name`: `<cluster-name>`

### Lifecycle management and rules

- **Creation**: The security group is created in the resolved cluster VPC when the cluster is created. Both real and mock clusters receive a security group. If a cluster is created without any VPC or subnets, `clusterSecurityGroupId` is omitted from the response. If a caller explicitly provides a `resourcesVpcConfig.vpcId` that does not exist in EC2, the request is rejected with `InvalidParameterException` (HTTP 400).
- **Deletion**: When the cluster is deleted via `DeleteCluster`, Floci deletes the associated cluster security group from EC2. If the security group was already removed out-of-band, the deletion succeeds idempotently without error.
- **Backfill**: Existing persisted clusters that were created before this feature receive an auto-generated cluster security group during startup backfill if their VPC is present.
- **Rules**: In accordance with AWS EKS behavior, the cluster security group includes a self-referencing inbound rule allowing all traffic from members of the same security group to enable control plane and node communication, a self-referencing outbound rule for Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) traffic, and the standard EC2 outbound rule.

## Encryption and logging configuration

EKS clusters support configuring KMS envelope encryption for secrets and control plane logging export.

### Encryption configuration

`CreateCluster` accepts an `encryptionConfig` array specifying the encryption provider for Kubernetes resources:

```json
{
  "encryptionConfig": [
    {
      "resources": ["secrets"],
      "provider": {
        "keyArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:000000000000:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Supported resources**: Only `["secrets"]` is supported by AWS EKS. Specifying any other resource or leaving resources empty causes `InvalidParameterException` (HTTP 400).
- **Provider**: `provider.keyArn` must be non-empty.
- **Cardinality**: AWS allows at most one encryption configuration entry. Specifying more than one causes `InvalidParameterException` (HTTP 400).
- **Omission**: When omitted at creation time, `encryptionConfig` is not populated and is omitted from `DescribeCluster` responses (null or omitted, no synthetic default).
- **Scope**: Floci stores and returns the encryption configuration faithfully. Envelope encryption of Secrets at the Kubernetes storage layer and KMS cryptographic operations are out of scope.

### Logging configuration

`CreateCluster` accepts control plane logging configuration in `logging.clusterLogging`:

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "clusterLogging": [
      {
        "types": ["api", "audit"],
        "enabled": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **Supported log types**: The valid EKS log types are `api`, `audit`, `authenticator`, `controllerManager`, and `scheduler`. Specifying an unrecognized type causes `InvalidParameterException` (HTTP 400).
- **Response normalization**: AWS EKS always returns the status of all five log types. Enabled types are returned first (`enabled: true`), followed by disabled types (`enabled: false`).
- **Default logging**: When omitted or empty at creation time, Floci returns all five log types disabled in a single entry (`enabled: false`).
- **Backfill**: Existing persisted clusters created before this feature was introduced are automatically backfilled on startup with default disabled logging.
- **Scope**: Floci stores and returns control plane logging configuration. Shipping log streams to Amazon CloudWatch Logs log groups is out of scope.

## Modes

### Mock mode (`mock: true`)

Cluster metadata is stored in-process. No Docker containers are started. The cluster transitions directly to `ACTIVE` on creation. Use this in CI or whenever you only need the EKS API shape, not a real Kubernetes API server.

### Real mode (`mock: false`, default)

Floci starts a **k3s** (`rancher/k3s`) container for each cluster. The k3s API server is exposed on a host port from the configured range (`6500-6599`). Once `/readyz` responds, the cluster transitions to `ACTIVE` and the CA certificate is extracted from the kubeconfig.

By default `describe-cluster` returns a **host-reachable** endpoint (`https://localhost:<hostPort>`); the k3s server certificate includes a `localhost` SAN, so it verifies against the CA in `cluster.certificateAuthority.data`. Set `endpoint-mode: network` to return the container DNS name (`https://floci-eks-<name>:6443`) instead: reachable from other containers on the Docker network (the pre-#1118 behaviour). In `network` mode the endpoint falls back to the host-reachable form when Floci runs natively, since there is no container DNS name a host client could use.

#### Connecting with `kubectl` (native AWS workflow)

The standard AWS flow works end to end:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name my-cluster
kubectl get nodes
```

`aws eks update-kubeconfig` wires `aws eks get-token` into the kubeconfig as an exec credential. The bearer token contains a SigV4-presigned STS `GetCallerIdentity` request. Floci validates its signature and 60-second presign expiry, then verifies the signed `x-k8s-aws-id` header against the cluster-specific `/_floci/eks/clusters/<cluster-name>/token-webhook` endpoint before resolving the caller identity. Instance-profile sessions require an EC2_LINUX access entry as described above; non-worker callers retain the `system:masters` mapping (bound to `cluster-admin`). No `aws-iam-authenticator` is required.

Create an IAM access key before using EKS authentication. The public local-development pairs `test`/`test` and `floci`/`floci` are deliberately rejected because the webhook grants cluster-admin access.

Temporary IAM credentials must include their `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` when signing the token.

This webhook is enabled by default (`iam-auth-webhook: true`). Set it to `false` to start k3s without it (in which case `aws eks get-token` tokens are rejected with `401`).

!!! note "Webhook reachability & networking"
    The k3s API server must be able to reach Floci's webhook URL. When Floci runs natively, k3s containers reach it via `host.docker.internal`; when Floci runs in a container (`floci start`), Floci and the k3s containers share a Docker network. The k3s network is taken from `FLOCI_SERVICES_EKS_DOCKER_NETWORK` if set, otherwise the global `FLOCI_SERVICES_DOCKER_NETWORK`, otherwise the network Floci is itself attached to (auto-detected), so no EKS-specific network configuration is required in the standard compose setup.

    The webhook kubeconfig is copied into the k3s container via the Docker API (not bind-mounted), so the token-webhook works the same in native and Docker-in-Docker modes with **no host-path / `host-persistent-path` configuration**.

!!! note "Docker socket required"
    Real mode starts privileged Docker containers. Mount the Docker socket and set the Docker network so containers can reach each other.

```yaml
services:
  floci:
    image: floci/floci:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ports:
      - "4566:4566"
    environment:
      FLOCI_SERVICES_EKS_DOCKER_NETWORK: my_project_default
```

!!! note "No port mapping needed for k3s ports"
    k3s containers bind their API server port (6500-6599) directly on the host via Docker: no `ports:` entry is required in `docker-compose.yml`. See [Ports Reference](../configuration/ports.md#ports-65006599-eks-real-mode) for the full explanation.

#### Clusters survive a restart

With a persistent [storage mode](../configuration/storage.md) (the default), clusters recorded in
`eks-clusters.json` are **re-latched to their k3s containers when Floci starts**:

- A surviving container (for example after a Docker Desktop / daemon reboot) is adopted and
  started in place, keeping its published API server port and data volume: deployments come
  back as they were.
- A missing container is recreated. Its named k3s data volume (`floci-eks-<name>`; for a
  [non-default account](../configuration/multi-account.md), `floci-eks-<account>.<name>`) is
  reused if it survived; volumes follow the global prune policy
  (`FLOCI_STORAGE_PRUNE_VOLUMES_ON_DELETE`, default `false`), so they are retained when the
  container is stopped or the cluster deleted, except in `memory` storage mode.
- A non-default-account cluster created before account-qualified naming keeps its historical
  `floci-eks-<name>` container and volume: restoration adopts the surviving container when its
  `io.floci.account` label matches the owning account, so pre-upgrade workloads are not
  orphaned.

A restored cluster reports `CREATING` until its API server answers again, then returns to
`ACTIVE` with a freshly extracted certificate authority. If the container cannot be brought
back (for example Docker is unavailable), the cluster is marked `FAILED` instead of appearing
`ACTIVE` while unreachable.

## Configuration

### Kubernetes versions and network configuration

Floci supports standard AWS EKS Kubernetes versions:

- `1.28` (`rancher/k3s:v1.28.15-k3s1`)
- `1.29` (`rancher/k3s:v1.29.14-k3s1`, default)
- `1.30` (`rancher/k3s:v1.30.10-k3s1`)
- `1.31` (`rancher/k3s:v1.31.5-k3s1`)
- `1.32` (`rancher/k3s:v1.32.2-k3s1`)

You can specify standard EKS `version` and `kubernetesNetworkConfig.serviceIpv4Cidr` when creating a cluster:

```bash
aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 eks create-cluster \
  --name my-cluster \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/eks-role \
  --version 1.31 \
  --kubernetes-network-config serviceIpv4Cidr=172.20.0.0/16
```

Floci automatically partitions internal pod CIDR blocks (`--cluster-cidr`) across clusters to avoid network collisions when running multiple local clusters concurrently.

### Pulling images from Floci ECR

Images pushed to the [Floci ECR registry](ecr.md) use `localhost`-based repository URIs
(for example `000000000000.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.localhost:4566/my-repo:tag`). Inside a k3s
cluster that hostname would resolve to the k3s container itself, and containerd insists
on HTTPS for anything it doesn't recognize as loopback: so, out of the box, k3s cannot
pull from the registry even though `docker push` from the host works.

Floci solves this at cluster creation: each new k3s container gets a generated
`/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml` that mirrors every repository hostname the emulator
can mint: the default account across the full region catalog, plus the path-style
`localhost:<port>` form used by `FLOCI_SERVICES_ECR_URI_STYLE=path`, to Floci's
in-network data plane. The same image
reference then works for the host-side push and the in-cluster pull, with no retagging
and no manual containerd configuration:

```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-repo
docker build -t 000000000000.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.localhost:4566/my-repo:v1 .
docker push 000000000000.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.localhost:4566/my-repo:v1

aws eks create-cluster --name demo ...
helm install my-app ./chart \
  --set image.repository=000000000000.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.localhost:4566/my-repo \
  --set image.tag=v1
```

Requirements and limits:

- The k3s container must reach Floci's Docker-network address. Set the global
  `FLOCI_SERVICES_DOCKER_NETWORK` as in the standard `docker-compose.yml` or the
  EKS service network variable.
- Only Floci-mintable hostnames are mirrored; public registries (docker.io, ghcr.io, …)
  are never touched.
- Repository URIs using a non-default `registryId` (account) are not covered.
- The mirror set is snapshotted when the cluster is created. Clusters created before this
  feature can be fixed manually because the k3s container filesystem survives a restart:

  ```bash
  docker cp registries.yaml floci-eks-<cluster>:/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml
  docker restart floci-eks-<cluster>
  ```

### Mock mode (CI / tests)

Use `FLOCI_SERVICES_EKS_MOCK=true` when you only need the API shape:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml: CI / test environment
services:
  floci:
    image: floci/floci:latest
    environment:
      FLOCI_SERVICES_EKS_MOCK: "true"
```

## Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)

When enabled (`FLOCI_SERVICES_EKS_IMDS=true`), each k3s cluster container exposes the AWS Instance Metadata Service on the link-local address `169.254.169.254:80`. Inside the container, Floci adds `169.254.169.254/32` to the loopback interface (`lo`) and runs a lightweight `socat` TCP relay forwarding metadata requests to Floci's IMDS server.

Both IMDSv1 and IMDSv2 (`PUT /latest/api/token`) are supported. The cluster container is registered as a synthesized EC2 instance node (type `m5.large`, image `ami-eks-k3s`) associated with the cluster's IAM role:

```bash
# IMDSv2: obtain token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
  -H "x-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")

# Read node instance ID
curl -s -H "x-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id
```

### Reachability and network namespaces

The link-local proxy attaches to the loopback interface of the k3s container network namespace (the node network namespace).

- **Reachable from node network namespace:** Workloads configured with `hostNetwork: true` share the node network namespace and can reach `169.254.169.254:80`. This allows local testing of host-network security policies, intrusion-detection rules, and credential exfiltration defenses.
- **Not reachable from ordinary pods:** Pods running in separate pod network namespaces cannot reach `169.254.169.254` through this loopback alias because link-local addresses are non-routable across network namespaces. Pod-CIDR DNAT routing is not implemented.

### Configuration

IMDS proxy initialization is disabled by default (`floci.services.eks.imds=false`). Set `FLOCI_SERVICES_EKS_IMDS=true` to enable the proxy setup inside the k3s container.

A failure to configure the proxy (for example on custom minimal images lacking network utilities) logs a warning and allows cluster startup to continue.

### Hop limits

EC2 metadata options store `HttpPutResponseHopLimit`, but the userspace TCP proxy relay terminates the incoming connection and opens a new connection to Floci, regenerating the IP packet TTL. Hop limits are recorded on the instance metadata options model but are not enforced by the userspace proxy.

## IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)

Every cluster gets an OIDC identity provider, so the full IRSA flow (trust policy, service-account token, `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`) works end to end without mocked or hardcoded tokens.

`CreateCluster` generates an RSA-2048 signing keypair and an AWS-shaped issuer URL, returned by `DescribeCluster`:

```json
{
  "cluster": {
    "name": "my-cluster",
    "identity": { "oidc": { "issuer": "https://oidc.eks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/id/3F8A…" } }
  }
}
```

The issuer URL is a faithful string for building trust policies, but it is not fetched: Floci's STS resolves the signing key in-process. The private key is held in storage separate from the cluster model and is never returned by any API.

### Service-account tokens

Floci supports two ways to obtain IRSA service account tokens:

#### 1. In-cluster projected tokens (real k3s mode)

In real mode (`mock: false`), Floci starts a k3s container for the cluster. When IRSA signing key support is enabled (`FLOCI_SERVICES_EKS_IRSA_SIGNING_KEY=true`, default `true`), Floci exports the cluster RSA keypair to `/etc/rancher/k3s/sa-signing-key.pem` and `/etc/rancher/k3s/sa-public-key.pem` with restrictive filesystem permissions (`0600`) before k3s starts.

The k3s API server is configured with:
- `--kube-apiserver-arg=service-account-signing-key-file=/etc/rancher/k3s/sa-signing-key.pem`
- `--kube-apiserver-arg=service-account-key-file=/etc/rancher/k3s/sa-public-key.pem`
- `--kube-apiserver-arg=service-account-issuer=<cluster-oidc-issuer>`
- `--kube-apiserver-arg=service-account-issuer=https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local`
- `--kube-apiserver-arg=api-audiences=https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local,sts.amazonaws.com`

This enables in-cluster pods to project service account tokens directly using Kubernetes standard projected volumes:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: irsa-workload
  namespace: default
spec:
  serviceAccountName: my-service-account
  containers:
  - name: workload
    image: my-workload:latest
    env:
    - name: AWS_ROLE_ARN
      value: arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/my-irsa-role
    - name: AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE
      value: /var/run/secrets/eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount/token
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount
      name: aws-iam-token
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: aws-iam-token
    projected:
      sources:
      - serviceAccountToken:
          path: token
          expirationSeconds: 86400
          audience: sts.amazonaws.com
```

Tokens projected with audience `sts.amazonaws.com` are signed by k3s using the cluster key and advertise the cluster issuer URL. When the AWS SDK inside the container calls `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`, Floci verifies the signature against the cluster public key and checks the trust policy conditions. In-cluster components that do not specify an audience receive tokens with both the in-cluster audience and STS audience, allowing normal Kubernetes operation without disruption.

#### 2. Minting a service-account token via HTTP (mock mode & out-of-cluster testing)

For local development harnesses running outside Kubernetes or when using mock mode (`FLOCI_SERVICES_EKS_MOCK=true`), tokens can be requested directly from Floci via HTTP. Signing happens server-side, so the private key never leaves Floci:

```bash
curl -sX POST http://localhost:4566/_floci/eks/clusters/my-cluster/oidc-token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"namespace":"my-namespace","serviceAccount":"my-service-account"}'
```

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs…",
  "issuer": "https://oidc.eks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/id/3F8A…",
  "subject": "system:serviceaccount:my-namespace:my-service-account",
  "audience": "sts.amazonaws.com"
}
```

`audience` (default `sts.amazonaws.com`) and `expirySeconds` (default 24h, max 7d) are optional. This is Floci plumbing under `_floci/…`, not an AWS API.

### Trust policy

Note that the OIDC provider ARN and the condition keys use the issuer with the scheme stripped `oidc.eks.<region>.amazonaws.com/id/<id>`, which is how the AWS console, `eksctl`, and Terraform all render it.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::000000000000:oidc-provider/<oidcProvider>"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "<oidcProvider>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<serviceAccount>",
        "<oidcProvider>:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

### What STS validates

When `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` receives a token whose `iss` names an issuer Floci hosts, it enforces all of:

- the RS256 signature, against that cluster's public key
- `iss` matches the cluster's issuer exactly
- `aud` contains `sts.amazonaws.com`
- `exp` / `nbf`, with 60s of clock-skew tolerance
- the role's trust policy: `Principal.Federated` and the `Condition` block, comparing `oidc:sub` / `oidc:aud` with exact, case-sensitive equality

The response then carries the token's real claims in `SubjectFromWebIdentityToken`, `Provider`, and `Audience`. Failures return `InvalidIdentityToken` (400) for a bad token, `ExpiredTokenException` (400) for an expired one, or `AccessDenied` (403) when the trust policy does not permit the subject.

A token whose issuer Floci does not host is treated as opaque and accepted, since Floci cannot adjudicate a third-party provider. Validation is therefore automatic for Floci-issued tokens and requires no configuration flag.

### OIDC discovery endpoints

Served for fidelity and debugging, nothing in the IRSA flow dereferences them:

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /_floci/eks/clusters/<name>/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration` | OIDC discovery document |
| `GET /_floci/eks/clusters/<name>/oidc/keys` | JWKS containing the cluster's public key |

These live under `_floci/…` rather than at the AWS-shaped issuer path, which Floci's embedded DNS does not resolve and which would collide with S3's path-style routing.

## ARN Format

```
arn:aws:eks:<region>:<accountId>:cluster/<clusterName>
```

Node groups use:

```
arn:aws:eks:<region>:<accountId>:nodegroup/<clusterName>/<nodegroupName>/<id>
```

Fargate profiles use:

```
arn:aws:eks:<region>:<accountId>:fargateprofile/<clusterName>/<fargateProfileName>/<id>
```

```bash
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test

System.out.println(described.cluster().status()); // ACTIVE

// List clusters
List<String> names = eks.listClusters(r -> {}).clusters();

// Node group and Fargate profile support are currently exposed through the REST paths.

// Tag resource
